      Hi mum, this is from your first daughter. <br>
      I designed this website for you. This is my special way of saying happy birthday, i hope this makes you happy. <br>
      Thank you mummy for being a fervent good mother. <br>
      Your unwavering love and dedication have shaped who I am today, and for that, I am eternally grateful. <br>
      Thank you for your endless support, your wise words, and the countless sacrifices you have made for our family. <br>
      I pray that God bless your new age. I also pray that you live long to watch all your children get married, hold all your children's children and watch all your children's children grow in grace and in knowledge of God. <br>
      As you add another beautiful year to your life, I pray in Jesus' name that your days are filled with joy, health, and countless blessings. May you continue to shine brightly and live a long, happy life. Happy birthday mummy, this is a day to celebrate. <br>

      Sent with much love.
